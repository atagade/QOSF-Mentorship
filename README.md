# QOSF-Mentorship

The analysis of my code experiment is written here, as a quick way to analyse the results. It would help if you went through the Task1 notebook to understand the workflow. 

I created 6 graphs to illustrate 6 scenarios, Random Vector: 1010, Gates: Rx-Ry, Rx-Rz and Ry-Rz
                                              Random Vector: 1111, Gates: Rx-Ry, Rx-Rz and Ry-Rz
                                             
I did this because during my experimentation I noticed that the results were substantially different based on the symmetric nature of the given random vector. 
It speaks to the fact that it is difficult to generalize the output of the given circuit to a non-symmetric vector and easier for a symmetric vector. By symmetric vectors I'm referring
to |0000> and |1111>. 

The following graphs denote the scenarios mentioned above:
